# Introduction to AWT and Swing

## 1. Concept

### AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)
AWT is Java's original platform-dependent windowing, graphics, and user-interface widget toolkit. It provides the foundation for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java.

- It is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC).
- AWT components are "heavyweight" because they rely on the underlying operating system's windowing components.

### Swing

Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java, developed as a part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC). It is built on top of AWT and provides a richer set of GUI components.

- Swing components are "lightweight" as they are written entirely in Java and do not rely on native GUI components.
- It provides a more flexible and customizable interface than AWT.

## 2. Applets

Applets are small Java programs that can be embedded in a webpage and run in the context of a browser.

- They extend the `java.applet.Applet` class (AWT-based) or `javax.swing.JApplet` class (Swing-based).
- Applets are now considered outdated and are not commonly used in modern Java applications due to security and compatibility issues.

## 3. Swing Class Hierarchy

### üî∫ Top Level: `Object`

- The root of all Java classes.
- Every class in Java implicitly extends `Object`.

### üîπ `Component`

- The superclass for all AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) components.
- It provides basic GUI features like size, location, and visibility.


### üîπ `Container` (extends `Component`)

- A `Component` that can contain other components.
- Key for building UI layouts.

### üîπ From `Container` it splits into three branches:
#### üì¶ 1. **Window ‚Üí Frame ‚Üí JFrame**
- `Window`: A top-level window with no borders or menu.
- `Frame`: A decorated window (with title, buttons, etc.).
- `JFrame`: A Swing version of `Frame`, commonly used for main application windows.

#### üì¶ 2. **Panel ‚Üí Applet ‚Üí JApplet**

- `Panel`: A generic container for organizing components.
- `Applet`: A container for Java applets (browser-embedded mini-apps).
- `JApplet`: Swing-based version of `Applet` with richer features.

#### üì¶ 3. **JComponent** (Core of Swing Components)

- All lightweight Swing components extend `JComponent`.
- Provides support for pluggable look-and-feel, double buffering, etc.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Under `JComponent`, it branches into:

#### ‚û§ `AbstractButton` ‚Üí `JButton`, `JToggleButton` ‚Üí `JCheckBox`

- `AbstractButton`: Base class for buttons.
- `JButton`: A push button.
- `JToggleButton`: A button that maintains its state (on/off).
- `JCheckBox`: A checkbox (a special kind of toggle button).

#### ‚û§ `JLabel`

- A component that displays a short string or an image icon.

#### ‚û§ `JComboBox`

- A drop-down list for selecting one item.


#### ‚û§ `JList`

- Displays a list of items for selection.

#### ‚û§ `JProgressBar`

- Displays progress visually for a task.
